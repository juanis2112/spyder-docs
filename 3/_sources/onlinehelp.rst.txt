The **Online Help** pane provides a built-in web browser to explore dynamically generated Python documentation on installed modules—including your own—rendered by a ``pydoc`` server running in the background.

=====================
Using the Online Help
=====================

Enter the name of the item you'd like documentation on in the :guilabel:`Module or package` field, or the :guilabel:`Get` field, to load its doc directly.
Or, if you're not sure of the name of the object you want help on, or are looking for a specific keyword, use the :guilabel:`Search` field to get a list of results.
You can view and re-run previous searches with the drop-down menu or the :kbd:`Down Arrow` key in the :guilabel:`Module or package field`, navigate previous pages with the forward and back buttons (top left, left and right arrows), and go back to the homepage with the home button (house icon top left) or the ``Module Index`` link top right.

Perform a realtime search within a page's content with the :guilabel:`Find` button (magnifying glass icon top left) or :kbd:`Ctrl-F`, navigate through matches with the Up and Down buttons, and make matching case sensitive with the :guilabel:`Aa` button.
You can use the zoom in/out buttons (:guilabel:`-` and :guilabel:`+`, top right), to change the font size to suit your preferences.
Finally, to cancel searching or page loading, click the stop button (red :guilabel:`X`, top right) and to reload the help content you're seeing to the most current version on disk (such as when you change your package's documentation), hit the refresh button (circular arrows, top right).
